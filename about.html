        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <h1 class="firstname">JERMELL</h1>
        <h1 class="lastname">PRIGEON</h1>
        <p class="bio"> Jermell Dante Prigeon was born August 3rd, 1988, in Ft Lauderdale, Florida. As a child he lived with his mother, 
            father and three siblings; his twin brother Termell, his two older sisters Camille and Ebonie. His mother and father influence 
            his life tremendously, he considers them both as his role models. At a young age Jermell decided he wanted to be an astronaut 
            or a writer, but after realizing that math wasn’t his favorite subject he embarked on his writing journey. Jermell faced some 
            adversity in his youth stages, he wanted to fit in, but he never felt like he had a group of people that would accept him for 
            who he is. As he faced challenges with acceptance, he found that music gave him an outlet. Learning how to play the violin, cello, 
            acoustic guitar, and drums became one of his passions. Music helped with his hobbies such as writing poetry and spoken word. 
            One of the hardest things he has accomplished is learning how to love himself. Going to therapy is one of the reasons he was able 
            to overcome this obstacle. His therapist helped him realize why he thought negatively about himself, understand why he felt the way 
            he did changed his life for the better. He received a bachelor’s degree in communications from Florida A&M University. In May of 2018 
            he joined the NBC universal news team. He has been working on this team as a lead digital strategist for two years. With over five 
            years of experience. He has written several stories within the past years. He has also appeared on an NBC news live segment called "NBC
            Six In The Mix". Jermell enjoys reading, traveling and all things music. He’s inspired daily by his parents, twin brother and 2 
            older sisters. Jermell currently lives in Texas, and is focusing on several entrepreneurship endeavors.</p>
